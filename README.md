# Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) Effect Simulation

This simulation models the Hong-Ou-Mandel quantum interference using Strawberry Fields. It demonstrates how two identical single photons entering a 50:50 beam splitter exhibit quantum interference by suppressing the `|1⟩|1⟩` coincidence outcome—characterized by the **HOM dip**.

## Key Features

- Uses Strawberry Fields to simulate photonic circuits.

Feel free to explore, tweak, and extend the simulation to experiment with multi-photon quantum effects!
